Roommate name = Jaseel Muhammed
Initially i thought that it will be difficult for me to adjust with him, as he is a dasa student but basically a south boy. 
So i thought it will be difficult but after 2-3 days we became good friends as well as good roommate but as the time passes it all sorted.
And we both are now happy in each other's company.
