# Git_Ready
## Task 3
### Step-1
- First checkout to the task3 branch.
- Create a new file named as `github-username.py`. For example, if github username is **Adi-R12** then file name will be `Adi-R12.py`
- Now answer the following four questions in the new file. The answer to each question should be present in a different commit with the commit message `Commit <Question No.>`
- **Ques1-** What is your favourite TV Show/Web Series? </br>
  **Ques2-** Why do you like the show/series? </br>
  **Ques3-** Name your crush(can be from outside the college too).</br>
  Now let's get serious. </br>
  **Ques4-** Suppose i made an empty folder in my local repository. Can i add and commit this change? Answer with a Y/N. </br>
  
- You should have 4 commits in your branch now. Push these changes to the `task3` branch and then make a PR. Be sure that you mention the `Issue No.` in the PR.

### Step-2
- You know what, I've changed my mind.
- Go back to your local system and delete the last 2 commits that you had made.
- Now push these changes as well. 

### Step-3
- Answer this last question. **Ques5-** What was your experience like during the FOSS Workshops?
- Save these changes but don't commit them, Store them away using git.

### Final Step
- You know what, I've changed my mind again ;). Change the commit message of the last commit present in your branch to `Commit Message changed successfully`
- Finally, get back the changes you had stored away and commit them with the message `Task 3 Completed`.
- Push all of these changes, and your task will end.
